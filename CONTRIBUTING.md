# CONTRIBUTING.md

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something, especially when you search for some perfect examples of projects to start. There's no other better way of learning than by actually doing. So, are you always on hunt for project ideas to work with in ReactJS? Do you keep finding nothing more than Todo list and Calculator? I understand your pain.
Here is a list of 99 projects anybody interested in learning and understanding moving parts of ReactJS should develop.




##### NOTE : Read the official React documentation for couple of days. Read few articles. Watch couple of videos. And, once you are able to grasp core concepts, start working on each of these projects to become master of ReactJS library.

Have you got some project ideas already? Feel free to fork this repo, contribute and make a Pull Request. Please maintain the consistency of repo structure if you decide to do so.

## Fork this repository
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open terminal and run the following git command:


`git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/99-reactjs-project-ideas`

where this-is-you is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of this repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

`cd 99-reactjs-project-ideas`

Now, create a branch using the git checkout command:

`git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>`

For example:

`git checkout -b new-branch`

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word add in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

`git status`

If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes. Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

For example - If you have added a Contributors.md named file then run the command mentioned below:

`git add Contributors.md`

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

`git commit -m "Add appropriate message here"`

## Push changes to GitHub
Push your changes using the command git push:

`git push origin <add-your-branch-name>`

Replace <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review
Now, If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.

## Create a pull request

Now submit the pull request. Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project after reveiwing.
